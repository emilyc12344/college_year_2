Q1:
O(n) as it depends on the length of the list passed through it as it iterates through it

Q2:
this binary search algorithm has O(logn) as each time it iterates it reduces the amount of possible values by half

Q3:
first loop: o(n) as each iteration does a constant time operation
second loop: o(n) same as above
whole programme: o(n) as 2 seperate loops, they are not nested

Q4:
o(logn) because the loops halfs i in each step

Q5:
o(n**2) beacuse of the nested loops

Q6:
o(2**n) as for each iteration it iterates two more times
